DESCRIPTION:Key Responsibilities

OVERVIEW

This position is somewhat flexible given the candidates experience, the main requirement being some DevOps experience. What do we mean by DevOps? Mostly npm, publishing node modules, Bash, husky, using a prettier/linter, setting up scss, debugging CircleCI build errors, and building testing frameworks (Jest).

We think DevOps will usually only take up about ¼ of your time with the remainder going to full-stack development. The development piece is also somewhat flexible based on your experience. If you lean front-end that’s fine, if you prefer the backend - great!

The primary responsibilities are to architect and implement new features for our live / virtual event app software (React Native app and React webapp), our admin panel (React), and the backend (Go). The digital team is small, so you will wear a lot of hats. You would be a resource for any questions our two strong junior developers may have. In addition to the core app used at events, we produce many one-off interactive experiences (React w Node backends) – these are a great opportunity to work on touchscreens, broadcast video, mini games, and other cool tactics.

We are looking for developers with at least 4 years of professional experience (the more the better). You must be able to jump in and write code that is clear and reusable, and should be largely self-directed and self-driven in your work. We are looking for someone who has a solid understanding of building well-structured backends/APIs and making decisions that will help our products and our codebase thrive. Any experience writing in Go/Gorm is a serious plus, but there is an opportunity to learn here. What do you bring to the table? Let us know!
